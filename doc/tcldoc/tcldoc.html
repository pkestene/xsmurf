<!-- =================== DESCRIPTION ======================= -->
<h2><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h2>
<blockquote>

  TclDoc parses the declarations and documentation comments in a set
  of Tcl source files and produces a corresponding set of HTML pages
  describing procedure declarations.  Run TclDoc on a set of files
  and/or directories.  It builds a rich internal representation of the
  files, determining both procedure declarations and procedure calls.
  TclDoc will run on <em>.tcl</em> and <em>.tsh</em> source files that
  are pure stub files with no procedure bodies. This means you can
  write documentation comments and run TclDoc in the earliest stages
  of design while creating the API, before writing the implementation.
 
<!-- ====================== TERMINOLOGY ========================= -->
  <h3><a name="terminology">Terminology</a></h3>
  A few terms have specific meanings within the context of TclDoc:
  <dl>
    <dt><em><a name="generateddocument">generated document</a></em>
    <dd>The document generated by the TclDoc tool from the comments in
    Tcl source code.
    <p>
    <dt><em><a name="filename">filename</a></em>
    <dd>The name of a file being processed, excluding any path
    information.  TclDoc is <strong>not</strong> designed to handle the
    situation where two files with the same name exist in different
    directories.
    <p>
    <dt><em><a name="procname">procname</a></em>
    <dd>A procedure name.  TclDoc can accomodate multiple procedure
    declarations, each of which is in a different file.  If a file has
    multiple declarations for the same procedure TclDoc will give
    priority to the last one specified.
    <p>
  </dl>
</blockquote>

<!-- ====================== SOURCE FILES ========================= -->
<h2><a name="sourcefiles">SOURCE FILES</a></h2>
<blockquote>
    TclDoc will generate output originating from four different
    &#34;sources&#34;: Tcl language source files for procedures
    (<em>.tcl</em> or <em>.tsh</em>), file-level summaries, overview
    comment file, and miscellaneous unprocessed files.

    <h3><a name="tclprocsource">Tcl Procedure Source Code</a></h3>
    Each procedure can have its own documentation comments contained in
    a <em>.tcl</em> or <em>.tsh</em> file.  For more details about these
    doc comments see <a href="#documentationcomments">documentation
    comments</a> and <a href="#proctags">procedure tags</a>.

    <h3><a name="filesummary">File Summary</a></h3>
    Each source code file can have its own documentation.  Typically
    this is used to provide a summary of the procedures contained
    within.  You may include special <a href="#fileoverviewtags">file
    overview tags</a> within the description.

    <h3><a name="overviewcomment">Overview Comment File</a></h3>
    Instead of using the generated index as the &#34;starting&#34;
    page to the HTML files you may choose to design your own overview
    file.  Typically this would include any documentation that applies
    to the entire application.  To create an overview comment file
    give it a name (such as <em>overview.html</em>), place it
    somewhere (typically at the top level of the source tree), then
    while running TclDoc to specify this overview file with the
    <kbd><a href="#--overview">--overview</a></kbd> option.  TclDoc
    does not process this file in any way; it merely copies it over to
    the destination directory and link to the copy.

    <h3><a name="unprocessed">Miscellaneous Unprocessed Files</a></h3>
    You can also include in your source any miscellaneous files that
    you want TclDoc to copy to the destination directory.  These could
    includes graphic files, example Tcl source, and self-standing HTML
    files whose content would overwhelm the documentation comment of a
    normal Tcl source file.
  
    <p>

    To include unprocessed files use the <kbd><a
    href="#--doc-files">--doc-files</a></kbd> option.  Specify either
    a filename or an entire directory; TclDoc will then copy this file
    or directory to the destination.  For many files you may find it
    more convenient to use the directory option, typically named
    <em>doc-files</em>.  This directory may include subdirectories as
    needed; TclDoc will recursively copy subdirectories as well.

    <p>

    All links to these unprocessed files must be hard-coded because
    TclDoc does not examine the files; it simply copies them.  For
    example, a link in a procedure comment might be:

    <blockquote>
      <pre># This button looks like this:
# &lt;img src="doc-files/Button.gif"&gt;</pre>
    </blockquote>

</blockquote>

<!-- ====================== GENERATED FILES ========================= -->
<h2><a name="generatedfiles">GENERATED FILES</a></h2>
<blockquote>
  TclDoc generates files with two types of names: those named after
  Tcl source code and those that are indices (such as
  <em>index_annot.html</em>).  Files in the latter group contain
  underscores to prevent filename conflicts with those in the former
  group.
  <p>
  <strong><a name="basiccontent">Basic Content Pages</a></strong>
  <ul>

    <li>One <strong><a name="markedup">marked-up source code
    page</a></strong> (<em>filename</em><code>.html</code>) for each
    source file it is documenting.  TclDoc adds three types of
    mark-ups per source file.  First it creates hyperlinks from
    procedure calls to their definitions.  If the definition is not
    within the same file TclDoc will search through all other scanned
    files for it.  Second it hyperlinks the procedure definition
    itself to its <em>annotated</em> entry (see below).  Third TclDoc
    highlights comments with a different color.

    <li>One <strong><a name="annotated">annotated page</a></strong>
    (<em>filename</em><code>-annot.html</code>) for each source file.
    TclDoc scans comment blocks for special <a
    href="#tcldoctags">TclDoc tags</a> which are collected to form
    the annotated source page.

    <li>One <strong>original code page</strong>
    (<em>filename</em><code>.txt</code>) which is merely a copy of the
    original source file.  TclDoc may be configured to skip this if
    given the <code><a href="#--dont-copy">--dont-copy</a></code> option.

  </ul>
  
  <p>
  
  <strong><a name="crossreference">Cross-Reference Pages</a></strong>
  <ul>
  
    <li>One <strong>filename index page</strong>
    (<code>index_file.html</code>).  This page alphabetically lists all
    scanned files and the procedures declared in each.  Procedure names
    are hyperlinked to the declarations on their respective <a
    href="#markedup">marked-up source page</a>.
    
    <li>One <strong>procedure declaration index page</strong>
    (<code>index_proc.html</code>) consisting of all procedure
    declarations alphabetically listed.  Again, each entry is
    hyperlinked to its respective <a href="#markedup">marked-up source
    page</a>.  If a procedure is declared in multiple files the index
    includes each definition.  For multiple declarations within the
    same file this index will link to the last instance.

    <li>One <strong>procedure call index page</strong>
    (<code>index_call.html</code>).  This index lists all instances of a
    procedure being called, either within the same file or from a
    different file.  The entries are hyperlinked to the line within the
    <a href="#markedup">marked-up source page</a> which makes the call.

    <li>One <strong><a name="master">master page</a></strong>
    (<code>index_main.html</code>) formed by the concatenation of the
    three previous indices.

    <li>One <strong>annotation index page</strong>
    (<code>index_annot.html</code>) that alphabetically lists all
    declared procedures and filenames.  Each item is hyperlinked to the
    description on their respective <a href="#annotated">annotated
    page</a>.

    <li>One <strong><a name="annotatedtoc">annotation table of contents
    page</a></strong> (<code>index_annot_full.html</code>) that gives a
    listing of all declared procedure and filenames as well as their <a
    href="#firstsentence">summary statements</a>.
    
  </ul>
  
  <p>
  
  <strong><a name="support">Support Files</a></strong>  
  <ul>
  
    <li>One <strong><a name="indexhtml">index.html</a> file</strong>
    which creates the HTML frames for display.  This is the file you
    load to display the front page with frames.  The file itself
    contains no textual content.

    <li>One <strong>overview page</strong>, if given as an option to
    TclDoc via the <kbd><a href="#--overview">--overview</a></kbd>
    option.

    <li>One or more <strong>doc-files</strong> directory that holds
    any image, example source code, or other files that you want
    copied to the destination directory.  These files are not
    processed by TclDoc in any manner -- that is, any TclDoc tags in
    them will be ignored.  This directory is not generated unless
    specified with the <code><a
    href="#--doc-files">--doc-files</a></code> option and a directory
    name is given.

    <li>One <strong><a name="exportrecord">export record</a></strong>
    if specified on the command line with the <code><a
    href="#--export">--export</a></code> option.  See the section on
    <a href="#exporting">exporting</a> for details. <strong>FIX ME!</strong>

  </ul>
  <p>
  <strong><a name="htmlframes">HTML Frames</a></strong>
  <p>

  TclDoc will generate two HTML frames as shown in the figure below:

  <blockquote>
    <pre>----------------
| I |  Detail  |
| n |          |
| d |          |
| e |          |
| x |          |
|   |          |
----------------</pre>
  </blockquote>

  Load any of the index files, with the exception of
  <em>index_main.html</em>, as the starting page to enable HTML
  frames.  Open any other files to have a frameless view.
  
</blockquote>
  
<!-- ================= DOCUMENTATION COMMENTS ==================== -->
<h2><a name="documentationcomments">DOCUMENTATION COMMENTS</a></h2>
<blockquote>

  <h3><a name="proccomments">Commenting Procedure Source Code</a></h3>

  To enable TclDoc commands include documentation comments in the
  source code ahead of declarations for a procedure.  These are also
  known as TclDoc comments.  A procedure comment consists of all
  contiguous comment lines preceeding the hash symbol; there may not
  be any blank lines betweent the comment block and procedure
  declaration.  TclDoc requires that comments be on its own line with
  any number of preceeding whitespace.  The following is an example of
  a legal procedure comment:

  <blockquote>
<pre># Initialize the widget for the next use.
  # This must be done before using it else
  # mass hilarity ensues.
proc init_widget {} {
  # ...
}</pre>
  </blockquote>

  Be aware that documentation comments placed in the procedure body
  are ignored.

  <h3><a name="filecomments">Commenting a File</a></h3>

  Commententing a file is similar to commenting a procedure.  To
  differentiate between a doc comment for an entire file and a doc
  comment for the first procedure use the special sequence
  <code>#//#</code> to delimit the file-level comment.  This sequence
  must be on its own line with any number of whitespace before the
  hash symbol.

  <blockquote>
<pre>#//#
# Here is where we discuss the file itself.
# ...
#//#

# This line summarizes procedure &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;code&gt;..
proc foo {} {
  # ...</pre>
  </blockquote>

  File-level comments may reside anywhere within the file.  If
  multiple blocks exist the last one takes precedence.
 
  <h3><a name="usingcomments">Using TclDoc Comments</a></h3>
  
  <strong>A comment is a set of descriptions and tags</strong> - The
  <em>description</em> consists all text in the comment block
  excluding the comment character <code>#</code> and any initial
  whitespace.  Certain character sequences, called <em>tags</em>, give
  the comment block a logical structure.  With the exception of
  <code><a href="#{@docroot}">{@docroot}</a></code> and <code><a
  href="#{@link}">{@link}</a></code> all normal textual descriptions
  must reside before supplying any tags.  There can be any number of
  tags in any order; some tags may be given multiple times.  In the
  example below the first line is a description while the second is a
  tag.

  <blockquote>
    <pre># This is a doc comment.
# @see tk_optionMenu</pre>
  </blockquote>
  
  <strong>Standard and in-line tags</strong> - A <em>tag</em> is a
  special keyword within a doc comment that TclDoc processes.  TclDoc
  has standard tags which appear as <code>@tag</code>, and in-line
  tags which appear within braces as <code>{@tag}</code>.  Normally
  standard tag appears at the beginning of a line, although nothing in
  TclDoc requires such.  To prevent text from being interpreted as a
  tag use the HTML entity <code>&amp;#064;</code> to represent the
  <code>@</code> symbol.  An in-line tag is allowed and interpreted
  anywhere that text is allowed; all other tags must be placed after
  normal text.  The following example contains the standard tag
  <code>@deprecated</code> and in-line tag <code>{@link}</code>.
  
  <blockquote>
    <pre># @deprecated As of phil 3.9, replaced by {@link #lennie}</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <strong>Comments are written in HTML</strong> - The text should be
  written in HTML, in that they should use HTML entities and can use
  HTML tags.  You can use whichever version of HTML your browser
  supports.
  
  <p>

  For example entities for the less-than (<code>&lt;</code>) and
  greater-than (<code>&gt;</code>) symbols should be written
  <code>&amp;lt;</code> and <code>&amp;gt;</code>.  Likewise, the
  ampersand (<code>&amp;</code>) should be written
  <code>&amp;amp;</code>.  The HTML tags bold (<code>&lt;b&gt;</code>)
  and image (<code>&lt;img&gt;</code>) are shown in the following
  example.

  <blockquote>
    <pre># This is a &lt;b&gt;doc&lt;/b&gt; comment.  We can even include
# our logo: &lt;img src=&#34;logo.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Company Logo&#34;&gt;.</pre>
  </blockquote>
  
  <strong>Leading characters</strong> - When TclDoc parses a doc
  comment leading hash (<code>#</code>) characters on each line are
  discarded.  Blanks and tabs preceding the <code>#</code> are also
  discarded.

  <p>

  <strong><a name="firstsentence">First sentence</a></strong> - The
  first sentence of each doc comment should be a summary sentence
  containing a concise but complete description of the declared
  procedure.  This sentence ends at the first period that is followed
  by a blank, tab, or line terminator.  TclDoc will strip away all
  HTML tags from this first sentence prior to copying it to the file
  or procedure summary at the top of the <a
  href="#annotated">annotated HTML page</a>.

  <p>
  
  <strong>Use header tags carefully</strong> - When writing
  documentation comments for procedures it is best not to use HTML
  heading tags such as <code>&lt;H1&gt;</code> and
  <code>&lt;H2&gt;</code> because TclDoc creates an entire structured
  document and these structural markups may interfere with the
  formatting of the generated document.  However it is fine to use
  these headings in file-level comments to provide your own structure.
 
</blockquote>
<!-- ====================== TAGS ========================= -->
<h2><a name="tcldoctags">TclDoc TAGS</a></h2>
<blockquote>

  TclDoc parses special tags when they are embedded within a Tcl doc
  comment.  These doc tags enable you to autogenerate a complete,
  well-formatted API from your source code.  The tags start with an
  "at" sign (<code>@</code>) and are case-sensitive; they must be
  typed in the lowercase letters as shown.  Customarily tags start at
  the beginning of a line although this is not a requirement.  By
  convention tags with the same name are grouped together.  For
  example put all <code>@see</code> tags together.
  
  <p>
  
  The currently implementd tags are:
  <ul>
      <li><code><a href="#@author">@author</a></code>
      <li><code><a href="#{@docroot}">{@docroot}</a></code>
      <li><code><a href="#@deprecated">@deprecated</a></code>
      <li><code><a href="#{@link}">{@link}</a></code>
      <li><code><a href="#@param">@param</a></code>
      <li><code><a href="#@return">@return</a></code>
      <li><code><a href="#@see">@see</a></code>
      <li><code><a href="#@since">@since</a></code>
      <li><code><a href="#@version">@version</a></code>
  </ul>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong><code><a name="@author">@author</a></code></strong>
    <var>name-text</var>
    
    <dd>Adds an "Author" entry with the specified <var>name-text</var>
    to the generated docs when the -author option is used.  A doc
    comment may contain multiple <code>@author</code> tags; TclDoc will
    concatenate all <var>name-text</var>s into one block.
    
    <p>
    
    <dt><strong><code><a
    name="{@docRoot}">{@docRoot}</a></code></strong>
    
    <dd>Represents the relative path to the generated document's
    (destination) root directory from any generated page. It is useful
    when you want to include a file, such as a copyright page or company
    logo, that you want to reference from all generated pages.
    Including a company logo from the top of each page is common.  A
    typical example might be:

    <blockquote>
      <pre># Built by &lt;br&gt;
# &lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;{@docRoot}/logo.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Logo&#34;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
# Burdell Industries, Ltd.&lt;/center&gt;</pre>
    </blockquote>

    Althought TclDoc does not currently create separate directories
    for each package a future implementation might.  Thus use of the
    <code>{@docroot}</code> tag is encouraged for future
    compatability.
    
    <p>

    <dt><strong><code><a
    name="@deprecated">@deprecated</a></code></strong>
    <var>deprecated-text</var>

    <dd>Adds a comment indicating that this API should no longer be
    used (even though it may continue to work).  TclDoc moves the
    <var>deprecated-text</var> ahead of the description placing it in
    italics and preceding it with a bold warning
    &#34;Deprecated&#34;.  The <var>deprecated-text</var>, if such
    exists, should tell the user when the API was deprecated and what
    to use as a replacement.  Consider including a
    <code>{@link}</code> tag that points to the replacement API.  If a
    doc comment has multiple <code>@deprecated</code> tags only the
    last one is used.

    <p>

    <dt><strong><code><a name="{@link}">{@link</a></code></strong>
    <var>filename</var><code>#</code><var>procname</var>
    <var>label</var><strong><code>}</code></strong>

    <dd>Inserts an in-line link with visible text <em>label</em> that
    points to the documentation for the specified <a
    href="#filename">filename</a> or <a href="#procname">procedure
    declaration</a>.  This tag accepts exactly the same syntax for <a
    href="#file+member"><var>filename</var><code>#</code><var>procname</var></a>
    and <var>label</var> as the <code>@see</code> tag, described
    below, but generates an in-line link rather than placing the link
    in the &#34;See Also&#34; section.  This tag begins and ends
    with curly braces to separate it from the rest of the in-line
    text.  If you need to use &#34;}&#34; inside the label use the
    HTML entity notation &amp;#125;
    
    <p>

    There is no limit to the number of <code>{@link}</code> tags allowed
    in a sentence.  You can use this tag in the description part of a
    documentation comment or in the text portion of any tag (such as
    <code><a href="#@deprecated">@deprecated</a></code>, <code><a
    href="#@return">@return</a></code> or <code><a
    href="#@param">@param</a></code>).

    <p>

    For example here is a comment that refers to the
    <code>load</code> procedure:

    <blockquote>
      <pre>Use the {@link #load [load]} procedure.</pre>
    </blockquote>

    From this, TclDoc would generate the following HTML (assuming the
    <code>load</code> function is declared within the same file):

    <blockquote>
      <pre>Use the &lt;a href=&#34;#load&#34;&gt;[load]&lt;/a&gt; procedure.</pre>
    </blockquote>

    Which appears on the generated annotation page as:

    <blockquote>
      <pre>Use the <a href="#load">[load]</a> procedure.</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <dt><strong><code><a name="@param">@param</a></code></strong>
    <var>parameter-name</var> <var>description</var>
    
    <dd>Adds a parameter to the &#34;Parameters&#34; section.  Use a
    different <code>@param</code> tag for each procedure argument.

    <p>
    
    <dt><strong><code><a name="@return">@return</a></code></strong>
    <var>description</var>
    
    <dd>Adds a &#34;Returns&#34; section with the
    <var>description</var> text.  This text should describe the return
    type and permissible range of values.  If a doc comment has multiple
    <code>@return</code> tags only the last one is used.

    <p>

    <dt><strong><code><a name="@see">@see</a></code></strong>
    <var>reference</var>
    
    <dd>Adds a &#34;See Also&#34; heading with a link or text entry
    that points to <var>reference</var>.  A doc comment may contain any
    number of <code>@see</code> tags, which are all grouped under the
    same heading. The <code>@see</code> tag has three variations; the
    third form below is the most common.
    
    <p>
    <dl>
      <dt><strong><code>@see</code></strong>
      &#34;<var>string</var>&#34;
      
      <dd>Adds a text entry for <var>string</var>.  No link is
      generated.  The <var>string</var> should be a reference to
      information not available by URL.  TclDoc distinguishes this from
      the other cases by looking for a double-quote
      (<code>&#34;</code>) as the first character.  For example:

       <blockquote>
         <pre>@see &#34;The Tcl Programming Language&#34;</pre>
       </blockquote>

       This generates the following:

      <dd>Adds a link as defined by <var>URL#value</var>. The
      <var>URL#value</var> is a relative or absolute URL. TclDoc
      distinguishes this from other cases by looking for a less-than
      symbol (<code>&lt;</code>) as the first character. For example:

      <blockquote>
        <pre>@see &lt;a href="spec.html#section"&gt;Tcl Specs&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
      </blockquote>

      This generates a link such as:

      <blockquote>
        <dl>
          <dt><strong>See Also:</strong>
          <dd><a href="spec#section">Tcl Spec</a>
        </dl>
      </blockquote>

      <dt><strong><code><a name="file+member">@see</a></code></strong>
      <var>filename</var><code>#</code><var>procname</var>
      <var>label</var>

      <dd>Adds a link with visible text <var>label</var> that points
      to the documentation for the specified <a
      href="#procname">procedure name</a>.  The <var>label</var> is
      optional; if omitted, the name appears instead as the visible
      text.  Use the label when you want the visible text to be
      abbreviated or different from the name.  Labels may contain
      whitespace.  TclDoc links to the file containing the first
      match.  If no declaration was found then it will blindly create
      a hyperlink to the contents of <var>filename</var>.
     
      <p>

      <strong>Example</strong> - In this example the <code>@see</code>
      tag in the <code>Widget</code> file refers to the
      <code>equal</code> procedure in file
      <code>String.tcl</code>. The tag includes both arguments: the
      name &#34;<code>String.tcl#equal</code>&#34; and the label
      &#34;<code>equal</code>&#34;.

      <blockquote>
        <pre># @see String.tcl#equal equal</pre>
      </blockquote>

      TclDoc produces the HTML code:

      <blockquote>
        <pre>&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See Also:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;String.tcl.html#equal&#34;&gt;equal&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;</pre>
      </blockquote>

      which looks like:
      
      <blockquote>
        <dl>
          <dt><strong>See Also:</strong>
          <dd><a href="String.tcl.html#equal">equals</a>
        </dl>
      </blockquote>
      
      <a name=specifyingname></a>

      <p><strong>Specifying a name</strong> - The
      <var>filename</var><code>#</code><var>procname</var> name can be
      either fully-qualified, such as <code>String.tcl#equal</code> or
      be just a procedure name, such as <code>equal</code> or
      <code>#equal</code>.  If less than fully-qualified, TclDoc
      assumes the procedure is declared within the same file and will
      create an appropriate hyperlink.  Otherwise if a filename is
      given TclDoc will determine where within the <a
      href="#destinationdir">destination directory</a> the file
      exists; usually this is the same directory, but may differ if to
      an <a href="#exporting">imported file</a>.  If for some reason
      the given filename is unknown then the entire name is copied
      verbatim.  An example utilizing this default behavior to link to
      an external page might be:
      
      <blockquote>
        <pre># @see overview.html#build_tree Tree Building</pre>
      </blockquote>

      This generates the following HTML:
      
      <blockquote>
        <pre>&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See Also:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;overview.html#build_tree&#34;&gt;Tree Building&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </dl>
            
    <p>
      
    <dt><strong><code><a name="@since">@since</a></code></strong>
    <var>since-text</var>
      
    <dd>Adds a &#34;Since&#34; heading with the specified
    <var>since-text</var> to the generated documentation.  The text has
    no special internal structure.  This tag means that this change or
    feature has existed since the software release specified by the
    <var>since-text</var>.  Multiple <code>@see</code> tags may be
    specified possibly to indicate when certain features have been
    added.  For example:

    <blockquote>
      <pre>@since 1.3</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <dt><strong><code><a name="@version">@version</a></code></strong>
    <var>version-text</var>
      
    <dd>Adds a &#34;Version&#34; subheading with the specified
    <var>version-text</var> to the generated output. The text has no
    special internal structure.  A doc comment may contain multiple
    <code>@version</code> tag, which are grouped together into one
    block.  Version normally refers to the version of the software that
    contains this file or procedure.

  <h3>TclDoc Options</h3>
  <dl>
  
    <dt><strong><a name="--help">-h, --help</a></strong>
    <dd>Displays a brief summary of TclDoc's options.

    <p>

    <dt><strong><a name="--verbose">-v, --verbose</a></strong>
    <dd>Use this option to have TclDoc write to standard output its
    progress.

    <p>
    
    <dt><strong><a name="--force">-f, --force</a></strong>
    <dd>Prevents requesting confirmation before overwriting a
    pre-existing destination.

    <p>
    
    <dt><strong><a name="--overview">--overview</a></strong>
    <var>path/filename</var>
    <dd>Specifies that TclDoc should retrieve the text for theoverview
    documentation from the &#34;source&#34; file specified by
    <em>path/filename</em> and places it as the <a
    href="#overviewcomment">overview page</a>.  The
    <em>path/filename</em> is relative to the current working directory.

    <p>
    
    While you can use any name you want for <em>filename</em> and
    place it anywhere a typical use is to name it
    <em>overview.html</em> and place it in the root directory of the
    source tree.
    
    <p>
    
    <dt><strong><a name="--doc-files">--doc-files</a></strong>
    <var>path</var>
    
    <dd>If given a filename copies it directory to the <a
    href="#destinationdir">destination directory</a>.  Otherwise if
    given a directory name designates it as the <a
    href="#unprocessed">doc-files</a>.  The contents of this
    directory, including subdirectories, are copied verbatim to the
    destination.  TclDoc will preserve the directory structure
    including keeping the tailing portion of the <em>path</em>.  That
    is, the new directory's name will be that of all characters
    following the final directory separator within <em>path</em>, or
    <em>path</em> if it has no separator.  Be aware that TclDoc
    <strong>will overwrite</strong> files in the destination
    directory.  <em>path</em> may be either relative or absolute.  Use
    this option multiple times to pull in additional files or
    directories.

    <p>

    <dt><strong><a name="--dont-copy">--dont-copy</a></strong>
    <dd>Disables copying the original source files to the destination
    directory to save disk space.  Note that hyperlinks will still be
    generated to these non-existant files.
    
    <p>

    <dt><strong><a name="--title">--title</a></strong> <var>title</var>
    <dd>Sets the title for the main <code><a
    href="#indexhtml">index.html</a></code> page.  Otherwise it defaults
    to <code>TclDoc Documentation</code>.

    <p>
    
    <dt><strong><a name="--header">--header</a></strong> <var>header</var>
    <dd>Specifies the header text to be placed above the navigation bar
    of each output file.  <em>header</em> may contain HTML tags and
    white space, though if it does it must be enclosed in quotes.  An
    example usage might be:

    <blockquote>
      <kbd>tclsh tcldoc.tcl --header &#34;&lt;em&gt;My API&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;v1.3&#34; <em>other options</em></kbd>
    </blockquote>
    
    <dt><strong><a name="--footer">--footer</a></strong> <var>footer</var>
    <dd>Specifies the footer text to be placed beneath the navigation
    bar of each output file.  <em>footer</em> may contain HTML tags and
    white space, though if it does it must be enclosed in quotes.

    <p>

    <dt><strong><a name="--hide-paths">--hide-paths</a></strong>
    <dd>Disables showing the original path name of the <a
    href="#tclprocsource">Tcl source code</a> in both the <a
    href="#annotated">annotated view</a> and <a
    href="#annotatedtoc">annotation table of contents</a>.  Consider
    calling this option whenever displaying the path poses a security
    risk.

    <p>

    <dt><strong><a name="--no-navbar">--no-navbar</a></strong>
    <dd>Prevents adding the navigation bar (<code>Index by: file name
    |</code> ...) at the top and bottom of <a href="#markedup">marked-up
    source code pages</a>, <a href="#annotated">annotated pages</a>, and
    the <a href="#master">master index page</a>.  Navigation bars will
    still exist at the top of each individual index page.
    
    <p>

    <dt><strong><a name="--date">--date</a></strong> <var>format</var>    
    <dd>While generating the timestamp at the bottom of <a
    href="#generatedfiles">generated files</a> TclDoc writes by
    default the date and time in ISO format.  Use this option to
    specify an alternative format using any legal string as allowed by
    Tcl's [clock format] command.  For example, the format string:

    <blockquote>
        <kbd>%h %e, %Y at %l:%M %p</kbd>
    </blockquote>

    yields the string <em>Oct 22, 2004 at 3:36 PM</em>.
    
    <p>
    
    <dt><strong><a name="--comment">--comment</a></strong> <var>color</var>
    <dd>Sets the foreground color used to highlight comments within <a
    href="#markedup">marked-up source code</a>.  Give the color as a
    set of six hexadecimal digits.  The default color, a pale green,
    is the value <kbd>208020</kbd>.
    
    <p>
    
    <dt><strong><a name="--page-bg">--page-bg</a></strong> <var>color</var>

    <dd>Sets the background color for all <a
    href="#generatedfiles">generated files</a>.  Give the color as a

    value <kbd>ffffff</kbd>.
    
    <p>
    
    <dt><strong><a name="--table-bg">--table-bg</a></strong> <var>color</var>
    <dd>Sets the background color for the table headers on <a
    href="#annotated">annotated pages</a>.  Give the color as a set of
    six hexadecimal digits.  The default color, a pale blue, is the

    <dt><strong><a name="--import">--import</a></strong>
    <var>path/filename</var>

    <dd> <strong>Not implemented yet.</strong> Reads and parses a
    previously written <a href="#exportrecord">export record</a>.  If
    the file does not exist, is unreadable, or in an invalid format,
    TclDoc will flag the error and terminate.  See the <code><a
    href="#--export">--export</a></code> option for details.
        
    <p>

    <dt><strong><a name="--export">--include</a></strong>
    <var>path/filename</var>

    <dd><strong>Not implemented yet.</strong>
    
    <p>

    <dt><strong><a name="--export">--export</a></strong>
    <var>path/filename</var>
    
    <dd> <strong>Not implemented yet.</strong> One powerful feature of
    TclDoc is its ability to perform <em>incremental commenting</em>.
    After scanning Tcl files and generating the various files, TclDoc
    may write an <em><a href="#exportrecord">export record</a></em> to
    disk.  This record holds a cache of calculated values from the
    program's execution.  A future invocation of TclDoc may then
    consult this record, using the <code><a
    href="#--import">--import</a></code> option, and build valid
    hyperlinks to the older files, just as if those older files were
    scanned along with the current ones.  One reasonable example might
    be if a vendor ships a library along with its TclDoc
    documentation.  The receiver might then want to generate its own
    documentation, linking its HTML files to the vendor's.  Rather
    than re-running TclDoc on the vendor's files, the receiver could
    opt to <code>--import</code> the vendor-supplied <em>export
    record</em>.

    <p>

    The <em>export record</em> holds the following values:

    <ol>
    <li>A list of the names of all scanned files, and the location of
        their generated pages (which may be modified by the <code><a
        href="#--export-loc">--export-loc</a></code> option.
    <li>A list of all found procedures, and their <a
        href="#firstsentence">summary statements</a>.
    <li>A list of all calls to known procedures.
    </ol>

    <p>
    
    Note that if a TclDoc invocation imports a <em>record</em>, its
    <em>export record</em> will include values from the previous record.
    
    <p>

    <dt><strong><a name="--export-loc">--export-loc</a></strong>
    <var>path/filename</var>
    
    <dd><strong>Not implemented yet.</strong>

    When exporting records, sometimes it is desirable that
    hyperlinks to the generated files differ from the <a
    href="#destinationdir">destination directory</a>.  Use this option
    to set the destination claimed within the export record.  For
    example, one might want to build the TclDoc files into a temporary
    directory, but then later write them onto a CD-R.  A future
    invocation of TclDoc might then want to hyperlink to those files on
    the CD-R via <kbd><a href="#--import">--import</a></kbd>.  Without
    the <kbd>--export-loc</kbd> option, the export record would still
    point to the temporary directory, which is no longer valid.  Rather,
    the user should specify <kbd>--export-loc
    <em>path_to_CD-R</em></kbd> during the first run of TclDoc so that
    the export record would claim the files reside on the CD-R instead
    of the temporary location.

    <p>

    Note that using this option does not modify files generated during
    the current invocation of TclDoc.  It only affects the export
    record.
